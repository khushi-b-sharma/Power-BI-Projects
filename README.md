# Power-BI-Project1:-
This is my first project on Employee Retention Rate. In this dashboard, I've illustrated key metrics such as the average retention rate across all departments and the average hourly rate for male research scientists. Additionally, it includes insightful statistics on attrition rate versus monthly income, average working years for each department, and the relationship between job roles and work-life balance. Moreover, it highlights the correlation between attrition rate and years since the last promotion. This comprehensive analysis provides valuable insights to improve employee satisfaction and retention strategies.
# Power-BI-Project2:-
This is my second project, focusing on restaurant ratings, cuisine combinations, restaurant chains, and geographic analysis. The dashboard showcases insights into popular cuisines, top-rated restaurants, and successful chains. Additionally, it includes a detailed geographic analysis to understand regional preferences. This project offers valuable data to enhance restaurant marketing and operational strategies.
